# book-search-engine
Weekly Challenge 21

<br> 

## Purpose

Convert RESTful API Book Search application to use GraphQL API with Apollo Server. When the user loads the search engine, they are presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup. Users can search for books on their desired topic using the input field. They can then save books to their account, and delete books from their account on the "See Your Books" page.

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

- Modified the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

- Created an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

- Application deployed to Heroku at https://pure-caverns-71807.herokuapp.com/
